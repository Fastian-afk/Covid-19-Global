# 🦠 COVID-19 Global Dataset: Exploratory Analysis & Predictions

This project performs an end-to-end **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and builds a **predictive model** using a **synthetically generated COVID-19 dataset**, replicating global pandemic trends such as cases, deaths, vaccinations, tests, and policy measures. It is ideal for practicing data science workflows, visualization, and machine learning techniques.

---

## 📁 Dataset Overview

- 📊 **Rows:** 3,000  
- 🧬 **Columns:** 26  
- 📌 **Source:** Kaggle (Synthetic Dataset)  
- 🧪 **Includes:**  
  - Total cases, deaths, tests  
  - Vaccination data  
  - Policy measures (e.g., stringency index)  
  - Demographics (age, population, hospital beds)  

---

## 🔍 Project Objectives

- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Visualize pandemic trends and policy responses  
- Generate heatmaps and pairplots for correlation and pattern insights  
- Build and evaluate a predictive model using linear regression  
- Forecast future cases using selected features  

---

## 📌 Key Features

### 📈 Visualizations

- Time-series plots for:
  - Total Cases, Deaths, Tests over time  
  - Vaccination Progress  
  - Government Policy Measures  
- Correlation Heatmap  
- Pairplot of critical features  
- Missing Data Heatmap  

### 🤖 Machine Learning

- Linear Regression Model  
  - Predicts Total COVID-19 Cases  
  - Uses features like total_tests, total_deaths, vaccinations, stringency_index  
  - Visual comparison of predicted vs. actual results  
  - Evaluation using Mean Squared Error (MSE)  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:**
  - `pandas`  
  - `numpy`  
  - `matplotlib`  
  - `seaborn`  
  - `scikit-learn`
